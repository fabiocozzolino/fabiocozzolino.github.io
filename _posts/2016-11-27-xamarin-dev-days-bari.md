Last Friday in Bari, DotNetSide has hosted one stop of the [Xamarin Dev Days](https://ti.to/xamarin/dev-days-bari) tour in Italy. It was really an amazing day spent with very passionate people talking about Xamarin and how is funny to develop with their tools.

During the day, we talked about Xamarin development with Xamarin.Forms combined with Cognitive Services, Mobile Apps, remote APIs and so on. In the afternoon, a great hands-on lab was made by around 40 people with the intention to share their knowledge (and win a Xamarin monkey! ðŸ˜€ ).

After the announcements made by Microsoft at Connect(); conference last week, we decided to include an extra slot to talk about Visual Studio for Mac, Visual Studio Mobile Center and .NET Standard.

It was a really great day. I like to see how many people loves their job and try to improve with great passion.

Thanks to all and thanks to the DotNetSiders! You rocks!
