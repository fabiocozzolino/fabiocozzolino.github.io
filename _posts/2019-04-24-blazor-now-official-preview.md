# What will ship when
Server-side Blazor will ship as part of .NET Core 3.0. This was already announced last October.
Client-side Blazor won’t ship as part of the initial .NET Core 3.0 release, but we are now announcing it is committed to ship as part of a future .NET Core release (and hence is no longer an “experiment”).
