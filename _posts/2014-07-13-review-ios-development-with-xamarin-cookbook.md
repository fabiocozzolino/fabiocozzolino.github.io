If you are looking for a fast and easy way to learn and apply immediately what you are learning, then <a href="http://www.packtpub.com/ios-development-with-xamarin-cookbook/book" target="_blank">iOS Development with Xamarin Cookbook</a>  is the perfect book for you.

This book is a cookbook, it follows the simple pattern Problem-Solution with the addition of a deep explaination about the implementation and why it works in that way. As any other Packt publication, the style is clean and fluid. I've read the e-book version, then I can't say a lot about the printed version.

Topics in the book are well organized. The first few chapters explain in an easily way the basics of iOS development, usage of development tools and the different concepts of iOS, and this makes the book suitable for beginners. More detailed topics are covered in the second part of the book. Personally, I would have liked to read a more extensive discussion of multitasking and others recipes in the Graphics and Animations chapter.

Finally, the book covers all the topics in a perfect way so it could be useful for both beginners and intermediates who look for fast solutions and expand on some themes.
