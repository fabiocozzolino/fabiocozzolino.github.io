The Italian Community Days is, since 2006, the most important event organized by all the .NET italian communities. 3 Days of sessions, labs, workshop, 5 parallels tracks, a lot of speaker, a lot of people, a great event!

For the first time in Italy me, and my friendÂ Pasquale Fersini, have made a presentation about <a href="https://github.com/xamarin/Monkey.Robotics" target="_blank">Xamarin Robotics</a>, an incoming library that "simplifies the task of building complex .NET Microframework (MF) powered robots and communicating with them from within Xamarin apps".

The library split in two main platform stack:
<ul class="task-list">
 	<li><strong>The Mobile Stack</strong> contains features for communicating with wearables (health monitoring devices and smartwatches) as well as microcontrollers (Netduino and Arduino)</li>
 	<li><strong>The Microcontroller Stack</strong> runs on .NET Micro Framework compatible microcontroller platforms such as the Netduino</li>
</ul>
Following the slides from our talk:
