The Italian Community Days is, since 2006, the most important event organized by all the .NET italian communities. 3 Days of sessions, labs, workshop, 5 parallels tracks, a lot of speaker, a lot of people, a great event!

For the first time in Italy me, and my friend Pasquale Fersini, have made a presentation about <a href="https://github.com/xamarin/Monkey.Robotics" target="_blank">Xamarin Robotics</a>, an incoming library that &#8220;simplifies the task of building complex .NET Microframework (MF) powered robots and communicating with them from within Xamarin apps&#8221;.

The library split in two main platform stack:

<ul class="task-list">
  <li>
    <strong>The Mobile Stack</strong> contains features for communicating with wearables (health monitoring devices and smartwatches) as well as microcontrollers (Netduino and Arduino)
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>The Microcontroller Stack</strong> runs on .NET Micro Framework compatible microcontroller platforms such as the Netduino
  </li>
</ul>
