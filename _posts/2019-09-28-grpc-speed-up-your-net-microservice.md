For those who still don't know, gRPC is a rpc (Remote Procedure Call) framework with high performance in mind. Born in Google and used for years, it has been recently released to the open source world and now is supported in about 10 specific languages: from C# to Java, C++ or Go.

# On the way to gRPC?
RPC is not a new concept. We starts to talk about RPC in the late sixties and the first real implementation comes in the early 80s, but it become popular in the nineties with Java Remote Method Invocation. So, why we are talking again? Well, in the past we try to manage RPC in many ways: CORBA, Java RMI, .NET Remoting, WCF are just some example of this attempt. 
But, why RPC? Well, in the last few years, new scenarios requires software architecture necessary adaptation: interoperability, openness, scalability, performance.



Enjoy!
