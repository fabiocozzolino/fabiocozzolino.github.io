This post is the first of a new series dedicated to .NET on AWS. Maybe not everyone knows that .NET is a first-class citizen on AWS. Just after the Java SDK, the .NET SDK was released in early 2010.

In this post, we are going to explore one of the alternatives ways to deploy a .NET web application in AWS: Blazor WebAssembly on Elastic Beanstalk.


It's been a really long time from my [last post](https://www.fabiocozzolino.eu/filesystem-subscriptions-rebus-extension/). Many things are changed in my personal life: my son was born on march (WOW!).

As you know, it is a life-changing event. No sleep for months and less free time for passions (sports, writing, etc.). Priorities are changed. It's always a problem of priorities. When you said "I have no time for...", you're actually saying that activity has a lower priority. You have other priorities.

So, now, let's restart my blog and community activities. 2022 is going to be a great year for developers.

Enjoy!
