Great! I would like to say thanks to all my friends and members of the DotNetSide user group that support me with great passion and enthusiasm!

Also thanks to Microsoft, in the person of Christina and Marjorie, and to all MVPs, a big family that loves share its passion for technology.

So, I'm now ready for a great new year. Microsoft made a big step forward embracing the open source world. We'll see what happens!
