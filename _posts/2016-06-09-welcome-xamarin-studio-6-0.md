Yesterday Miguel, during its [talk at dotNetConf](https://channel9.msdn.com/Events/dotnetConf/2016/NET-Conf-Day-2-Keynote-Miguel-de-Icaza), has announced the release of Xamarin Studio 6.0. With this version you got a lot of benefits &#8220;_including enhanced code completion, full C# 6.0 support, and a new formatting engine_&#8221; thanks to the new type system, now powered by Roslyn, the Microsoft’s open source .NET compiler platform.

But, you know, the feature that I really like in this cycle 7 is the **dark theme in Xamarin Studio 6**!

[<img class="alignnone" src="https://i0.wp.com/s3.amazonaws.com/blog.xamarin.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/02143433/Dark-Theme-Xamarin-Studio.png?resize=762%2C467&#038;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" />](https://blog.xamarin.com/live-from-dotnetconf-cycle-7-xamarin-studio-6-and-more/)

the reason is the simplest one : I like the Visual Studio 2015 Dark Theme and, since I work with both, switch from a white background to a black background, and viceversa, is not a good idea for my eyes . Furthermore , the dark theme is more relaxing for me.

Well done guys !

Ps.: obviously there is much more, like the full support of C# 6.0 for code completion and refactoring operations! Ah, don&#8217;t forget also the ability to move windows outside!

Check here the entire list of changes:
