It's been a really long time from my [last post](https://www.fabiocozzolino.eu/filesystem-subscriptions-rebus-extension/). Many things are changed in my personal life: my son was born on march (WOW!).

As you know, it is a life-changing event. No sleep for months and less free time for passions (sports, writing, etc.). Priorities are changed. It's always a problem of priorities. When you said "I have no time for...", you're actually saying that activity has a lower priority. You have other priorities.

So, now, let's restart my blog and community activities. 2022 is going to be a great year for developers.

Enjoy!
