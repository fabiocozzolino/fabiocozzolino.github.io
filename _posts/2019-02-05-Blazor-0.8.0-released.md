As reported in [MSDN blog post](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/webdev/2019/02/05/blazor-0-8-0-experimental-release-now-available/), Blazor 0.8.0 was just released! It is still an experimental framework, but now the path is clear since the team made a big announce: <b>Server-side Blazor is now ASP.NET Core Razor Components in .NET Core 3.0</b>

> As was recently announced, server-side Blazor is now shipping as ASP.NET Core Razor Components in .NET Core 3.0. We've integrated the Blazor component model into ASP.NET Core 3.0 and renamed it to Razor Components. Blazor 0.8.0 is now built on Razor Components and enables you to host Razor Components in the browser on WebAssembly.

So ... stay tuned!
