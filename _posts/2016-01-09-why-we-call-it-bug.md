Why software error or anomaly is called "bug"?

One of the first big calculator, the Mark II, suddenly stopped to work during one <img class="alignright" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8a/H96566k.jpg" alt="" width="263" height="207" />night. Engineers, as they tried the problem, they found a moth (bug) trapped in a relay.

This was the "first case of bug being found".

Starting from that event, the act of looking for a bug was called "debugging", that means "pest control".

Nice story :)
