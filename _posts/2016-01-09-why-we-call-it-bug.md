Why software error or anomaly is called &#8220;bug&#8221;?

One of the first big calculator, the Mark II, suddenly stopped to work during one <img class="alignright" src="https://i2.wp.com/upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8a/H96566k.jpg?resize=263%2C207&#038;ssl=1" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" />night. Engineers, as they tried the problem, they found a moth (bug) trapped in a relay.

This was the &#8220;first case of bug being found&#8221;.

Starting from that event, the act of looking for a bug was called &#8220;debugging&#8221;, that means &#8220;pest control&#8221;.

Nice story ðŸ™‚
